* Added plot generation utilities to the C++ code
* Fixed minor bugs in L-P and SRIM models
* Added new test utility for plots

2013-05-22   Alex Zylstra   <azylstra@psfc.mit.edu>
* Fixed bug in iterative methods that would cause inappropriate exceptions
* Fixed bug in SRIM stopping power dEdx when called right at E limits
* Made all energy limits consistently inclusive
* Created test suite
* Updated Li-Petrasso model to use kT/m when calculating x^t/f and changed calculation
of the collective modes to use Bessel functions (valid for all x). Also changed relative
velocity to use analytic expression from Hans instead of simple quadrature sum.

2013-05-21   Alex Zylstra   <azylstra@psfc.mit.edu>
* Included first (alpha) version of Java GUI

2013-05-07   Alex Zylstra   <azylstra@psfc.mit.edu>
* Improved doxygen documentation throughout code
* Added function for calculating particle ranges
* Updated C++ example for former
* Improved error handling via exceptions on C++ side
* Added wrappers for C++ -> Java exception mapping

2013-04-03   Alex Zylstra   <azylstra@psfc.mit.edu>
* Edited header and source files to (mostly) conform to Google code standards
* Fixed bug where StopPow::Eout, StopPow::Ein, and StopPow::Thickness did not properly handle remainders (accuracy limited to step size)
* Added energy limit checking to StopPow_LP and StopPow_BetheBloch
* Added Emin and Emax accessor virtual methods to StopPow interface
* Implemented Emin and Emax in SRIM, LP, Bethe-Bloch
* Added Emin and Emax to limit checking in StopPow::Eout, StopPow::Ein, StopPow::Thickness
* Updated SWIG scripts

2013-03-29   Alex Zylstra   <azylstra@psfc.mit.edu>
* v0.1 - First released version. SRIM and L-P models complete. 
* B-B model implementation lacking Ibar data for Z>6.
